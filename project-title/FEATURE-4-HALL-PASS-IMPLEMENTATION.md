## 🧪 **QR Code Implementation**

### QR Code Data Structure
```json
{
  "id": "hall-pass-001",
  "code": "A1B2C3D4",
  "destination": "Restroom",

const passData = {
  student_name: "Alice Johnson",
  destination: "Nurse",
  expected_duration: 10,
  notes: "Feeling unwell"
};

// System generates unique pass with QR code
const response = await fetch('/@@hall-pass-manager', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify(passData)
});
```

### Return a Pass
```javascript
// Teacher clicks "Mark Returned" on pass card
const response = await fetch('/hall-pass-123/@@return-pass', {
  method: 'PATCH'
});
// Pass automatically moved to "Recently Returned" section
```

### QR Code Verification
```javascript
// Scan QR code to verify pass
const qrData = JSON.parse(scannedCode);
// Returns: { id: "hall-pass-123", code: "A1B2C3D4", destination: "Library" }
