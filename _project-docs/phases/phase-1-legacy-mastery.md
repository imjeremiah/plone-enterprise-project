# Phase 1: Platform Analysis & Feature Planning

## Scope
Analyze modern Plone 6.1.2 architecture for extension points and conduct conceptual legacy analysis to understand evolution from older Plone versions. Map integration points for the 6 educational features and identify teacher workflow gaps. This phase provides the "understanding" required by the grading rubric while planning practical implementation.

## Deliverables
- Conceptual legacy comparison (Plone 2.x/3.x vs 6.1.2)
- Feature integration map showing where each of 6 features plugs into Plone
- Teacher workflow gap analysis with vanilla Plone
- Technical approach documentation for risk-free implementation
- AI usage documentation for architecture exploration

## Tasks/Features

### Task 1: Conceptual Legacy Analysis
1. Research Plone 2.7/3.x architecture patterns (via documentation/articles)
2. Document key differences:
   - Python 2.7 → Python 3.12 migration benefits
   - Zope 2 → Zope 5 improvements  
   - Classic UI → Volto React frontend
   - Archetypes → Dexterity content types
3. Create comparison showing how modern Plone addresses legacy limitations
4. Frame our project as "leveraging evolved Plone" rather than migrating
5. Document in `_project-docs/plone/legacy-evolution-analysis.md`

### Task 2: Feature Integration Mapping
1. For each of the 6 features, identify:
   - Integration points in Plone architecture
   - Required components (behaviors, viewlets, utilities)
   - Risk assessment (what could break)
   - Implementation approach
2. Create feature matrix:
   ```
   Feature 1: Google OAuth → pas.plugins.authomatic
   Feature 2: Standards Alignment → Dexterity behaviors + vocabularies
   Feature 3: Enhanced Search → Portal Catalog customization
   Feature 4: Mobile UX → Volto theme customization
   Feature 5: Dashboard → Volto blocks + plone.restapi
   Feature 6: Google Classroom → External API client + content adapters
   ```
3. Document in `_project-docs/plone/feature-integration-map.md`

### Task 3: Teacher Workflow Analysis
1. Map current vanilla Plone workflow for content creation
2. Identify pain points for teachers:
   - No standards alignment
   - Limited collaboration features
   - No Google Classroom integration
   - Desktop-focused interface
   - No analytics dashboard
3. Document how each feature addresses specific pain points
4. Create before/after workflow comparison
5. Save as `_project-docs/plone/teacher-workflow-gaps.md`

### Task 4: Technical Approach & Risk Mitigation
1. Document implementation strategy:
   - Use Plone add-on pattern (no core modifications)
   - Leverage ZCA for clean integration
   - Test each feature in isolation
   - Maintain upgrade path
2. Create testing checklist for each feature
3. Plan rollback strategy if features cause issues
4. Document in `_project-docs/plone/implementation-strategy.md`

## Impacted Files and Directories
- **New Documentation**: 
  - `_project-docs/plone/legacy-evolution-analysis.md`
  - `_project-docs/plone/feature-integration-map.md`
  - `_project-docs/plone/teacher-workflow-gaps.md`
  - `_project-docs/plone/implementation-strategy.md`
- **Existing Docs** (reference only):
  - Review all files in `_project-docs/plone/`
  - No modifications to existing architecture docs
- **AI Usage Log**: Start `_project-docs/ai-usage.md`

**Review Checklist**:
- ✅ Legacy analysis provides context without actual migration
- ✅ All 6 features have clear integration points mapped
- ✅ Teacher pain points documented with solutions
- ✅ Technical risks identified and mitigated
- ✅ AI usage documented for architecture exploration
- ✅ Ready to start feature implementation

## Rules Adherence
- No core Plone modifications (add-on pattern only)
- Follow ZCA principles for integrations
- Maintain clear separation of concerns
- Document all architectural decisions

## Key Insights for Grading
This phase satisfies the "Legacy System Understanding" criterion by:
1. Demonstrating knowledge of Plone's evolution
2. Understanding core architecture and extension points
3. Identifying business logic to preserve (workflows, permissions)
4. Planning modernization without breaking core functionality

## Iteration Notes
This analysis phase should take maximum 1 day. The real value comes from feature implementation (Phase 3), which is 50% of the grade. Move quickly through analysis to maximize development time.
