# UI Design Principles for K-12 Classroom Management Platform

This document defines the core UI/UX principles for our K-12 Classroom Management Platform built on Plone 6.1.2 with Volto React frontend. These principles guide the creation of interfaces that serve teachers managing their classrooms, emphasizing **real-time control**, **efficiency**, and **situational awareness** while maintaining Plone's architectural integrity.

## Core Design Values

### 1. Real-Time Classroom Control
Teachers need instant access to classroom management tools. Every interaction should provide immediate feedback and control over the classroom environment.

### 2. Progressive Information Display
Complex classroom data should be presented in digestible layers, from at-a-glance status to detailed analytics.

### 3. Touch-First Reality
Many teachers use tablets while moving around the classroom. The platform must work flawlessly with touch interactions.

## Design Principles

## 1. Modularity Through Classroom Management Widgets

### Description
Leverage Volto's block system to create reusable classroom management components that teachers can arrange on their dashboard.

### Implementation
- **Timer Blocks**: Countdown, elapsed time, multi-timer management
- **Seating Blocks**: Grid view, list view, group arrangements
- **Status Blocks**: Active hall passes, participation tracking
- **Control Blocks**: Quick actions, random picker, announcements

### Patterns
```javascript
// Classroom widget registration example
const TimerWidgetBlock = {
  id: 'timerWidget',
  title: 'Lesson Timer',
  icon: clockSVG,
  group: 'classroom',
  view: TimerWidgetView,
  edit: TimerWidgetEdit,
  schema: TimerWidgetSchema,
};
```

### Best Practices
- Each widget should work standalone or in dashboard
- Provide visual and audio feedback
- Support touch gestures for common actions
- Enable quick configuration without leaving dashboard

---

## 2. Accessibility as Classroom Equity

### Description
Ensure all teachers can use the platform regardless of abilities or classroom environment.

### Requirements
- **WCAG 2.1 AA** compliance minimum
- **Screen Reader**: Full compatibility for visually impaired teachers
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Complete functionality without mouse/touch
- **High Noise Tolerance**: Visual alerts for noisy environments

### Implementation Patterns
```jsx
// Accessible timer component
<div 
  role="timer"
  aria-live="polite"
  aria-label={`Timer: ${minutes} minutes ${seconds} seconds remaining`}
  className="timer-widget"
>
  <span className="timer-display" aria-hidden="true">
    {formatTime(remainingTime)}
  </span>
  <div className="timer-controls">
    {/* Accessible controls */}
  </div>
</div>
```

### Specific Accommodations
- High contrast mode for projector use
- Large touch targets for tablet use
- Visual + audio alerts for timers
- Color-blind safe status indicators
- Offline capability for unreliable internet

---

## 3. Responsive Design for Active Teaching

### Description
Design for teachers who are moving around the classroom, not sitting at a desk.

### Breakpoint Strategy
```css
/* Mobile First Approach */
/* Phone: 320px - 639px (default) */
/* Tablet: 640px - 1023px (primary target) */
@media (min-width: 640px) { }
/* Desktop: 1024px+ (dashboard view) */
@media (min-width: 1024px) { }
/* Wide: 1280px+ (multi-class view) */
@media (min-width: 1280px) { }
```

### Tablet-First Patterns
- **Floating Controls**: Timer and picker always accessible
- **Swipe Gestures**: Quick navigation between features
- **Touch Optimized**: Large buttons, clear spacing
- **Portrait Mode**: Optimized for one-handed use
- **Landscape Mode**: Side-by-side feature view

### Standing Desk Mode
- Extra large controls for distance viewing
- High contrast for visibility
- Simplified interface for quick glances

---

## 4. Intuitive Classroom Workflows

### Description
Mirror natural classroom management patterns while adding digital enhancements.

### Key Workflows

#### Daily Classroom Flow
```
Morning Setup → Active Teaching → Transitions → Monitoring → End of Day
```

#### Quick Action Patterns
- Single tap for common actions (start timer, pick student)
- Long press for options (timer presets, picker settings)
- Swipe for navigation (between classes, features)
- Pinch to zoom seating chart

### Navigation Principles
- **Persistent Dashboard**: Always one tap away
- **Feature Cards**: Visual organization of tools
- **Smart Defaults**: Remember last settings
- **Contextual Actions**: Based on time of day

### Implementation
```jsx
// Smart classroom assistant
const ClassroomAssistant = () => {
  const currentPeriod = useCurrentPeriod();
  const suggestions = useClassroomSuggestions(currentPeriod);
  
  return (
    <div className="classroom-assistant">
      <h4>Quick Actions for {currentPeriod.name}</h4>
      {suggestions.map(action => (
        <QuickAction key={action.id} {...action} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

---

## 5. Real-Time Awareness

### Description
Provide continuous awareness of classroom status without requiring active monitoring.

### Status Indicators
- **Visual Badges**: Pass count, timer status, alerts
- **Ambient Information**: Color-coded states
- **Progressive Alerts**: Subtle → obvious as urgency increases
- **Glanceable Dashboard**: Full status in 2 seconds

### Implementation
```jsx
// Real-time status bar
const ClassroomStatusBar = {
  displays: [
    { id: 'passes', icon: 'hall-pass', count: activePassCount },
    { id: 'timer', icon: 'clock', status: timerStatus },
    { id: 'alerts', icon: 'alert', priority: highestAlert }
  ],
  updateInterval: 1000 // 1 second updates
};
```

---

## 6. Performance for Classroom Devices

### Description
Optimize for school tablets and varying network conditions.

### Performance Targets
- Initial load: < 2 seconds on tablet
- Interaction response: < 100ms
- Offline capability for core features
- Battery efficient for all-day use

### Optimization Strategies
```javascript
// Efficient updates
const DashboardUpdater = () => {
  // Only update changed widgets
  const updates = useMemo(() => 
    calculateMinimalUpdates(previousState, currentState),
    [previousState, currentState]
  );
  
  // Batch DOM updates
  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    applyUpdates(updates);
  }, [updates]);
};
```

### Offline Support
- Timer continues without connection
- Seating chart editable offline
- Hall passes queue for sync
- Dashboard shows cached data

---

## 7. Contextual Help & Teacher Support

### Description
Provide help without disrupting classroom flow.

### Help Patterns
- **Quick Tips**: First use of features
- **Gesture Hints**: Show available actions
- **Video Tutorials**: 30-second feature guides
- **Peer Examples**: How other teachers use features

### Implementation
```jsx
// Non-intrusive help
const FeatureHint = ({ feature, dismissible = true }) => {
  const [show, setShow] = useState(isFirstUse(feature));
  
  if (!show) return null;
  
  return (
    <div className="feature-hint" role="tooltip">
      <span>{getHintText(feature)}</span>
      {dismissible && (
        <button onClick={() => setShow(false)} aria-label="Dismiss hint">
          ×
        </button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```
