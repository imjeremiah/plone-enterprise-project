# UI Design Principles for K-12 Educational Platform

This document defines the core UI/UX principles for our K-12 Educational Content Platform built on Plone 6.1.2 with Volto React frontend. These principles guide the creation of interfaces that serve teachers in under-resourced schools, emphasizing **efficiency**, **clarity**, and **collaboration** while maintaining Plone's architectural integrity.

## Core Design Values

### 1. Teacher-Centered Efficiency
Teachers have limited time. Every interaction should minimize clicks and cognitive load while maximizing educational impact.

### 2. Progressive Disclosure
Complex features should reveal themselves gradually as teachers become more comfortable with the platform.

### 3. Mobile-First Reality
Many teachers use personal devices. The platform must work flawlessly on phones and tablets.

## Design Principles

## 1. Modularity Through Educational Building Blocks

### Description
Leverage Volto's block system to create reusable educational components that teachers can mix and match.

### Implementation
- **Lesson Blocks**: Text, media, activity, assessment, discussion
- **Resource Blocks**: File attachments, external links, embedded content
- **Standards Blocks**: Alignment widgets, learning objectives, success criteria
- **Collaboration Blocks**: Co-teacher notes, peer feedback, version history

### Patterns
```javascript
// Educational block registration example
const LessonObjectiveBlock = {
  id: 'lessonObjective',
  title: 'Learning Objective',
  icon: targetSVG,
  group: 'educational',
  view: LessonObjectiveView,
  edit: LessonObjectiveEdit,
  schema: LessonObjectiveSchema,
};
```

### Best Practices
- Each block should work standalone or combined
- Provide sensible defaults for quick creation
- Include help text and examples within blocks
- Support copy/paste between lessons

---

## 2. Accessibility as Educational Equity

### Description
Ensure all teachers and students can use the platform regardless of abilities or technology access.

### Requirements
- **WCAG 2.1 AA** compliance minimum
- **Screen Reader**: Full compatibility with NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Complete functionality without mouse
- **Low Bandwidth**: Core features work on 3G connections

### Implementation Patterns
```jsx
// Accessible lesson card component
<article 
  role="article"
  aria-label={`Lesson: ${lesson.title}`}
  className="lesson-card"
>
  <h3 id={`lesson-${lesson.id}`}>{lesson.title}</h3>
  <div aria-describedby={`lesson-${lesson.id}`}>
    {/* Content */}
  </div>
</article>
```

### Specific Accommodations
- High contrast mode toggle
- Font size controls (not just browser zoom)
- Simplified navigation mode
- Print-friendly lesson views
- Offline capability for key features

---

## 3. Responsive Design for Real Classrooms

### Description
Design for the devices teachers actually use, in the environments where they work.

### Breakpoint Strategy
```css
/* Mobile First Approach */
/* Phone: 320px - 639px (default) */
/* Tablet: 640px - 1023px */
@media (min-width: 640px) { }
/* Desktop: 1024px+ */
@media (min-width: 1024px) { }
/* Wide: 1280px+ */
@media (min-width: 1280px) { }
```

### Mobile Patterns
- **Bottom Navigation**: Primary actions always accessible
- **Swipe Gestures**: Navigate between lessons
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Advanced features on larger screens
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 48x48px
- **Thumb-Friendly Zones**: Critical actions in easy reach

### Tablet Optimization
- Split-screen lesson editing
- Drag-and-drop on touch
- Stylus support for annotations

---

## 4. Intuitive Teacher Workflows

### Description
Mirror familiar teaching processes while introducing powerful digital capabilities.

### Key Workflows

#### Lesson Planning Flow
```
Dashboard → Browse/Search → Create/Adapt → Enrich → Review → Share → Teach → Reflect
```

#### Quick Actions Pattern
- Floating Action Button (FAB) for primary creation
- Context menus for resource management
- Bulk operations for semester planning
- Quick duplicate for differentiation

### Navigation Principles
- **Breadcrumbs**: Always show context
- **Recent Items**: Quick access sidebar
- **Smart Search**: Understands educational terms
- **Predictive Navigation**: Suggest next logical step

### Implementation
```jsx
// Smart workflow assistant
const WorkflowAssistant = () => {
  const suggestions = useWorkflowSuggestions(currentContext);
  return (
    <div className="workflow-assistant">
      <h4>Suggested Next Steps</h4>
      {suggestions.map(suggestion => (
        <WorkflowSuggestion key={suggestion.id} {...suggestion} />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};
```

---

## 5. Collaborative by Design

### Description
Foster sharing and peer learning among teachers within and across schools.

### Collaboration Features
- **Real-time Indicators**: Show who's viewing/editing
- **Inline Comments**: Contextual feedback on lessons
- **Version Comparison**: Track changes over time
- **Attribution**: Clear credit for contributions

### Privacy Controls
```jsx
// Granular sharing controls
const SharingControls = {
  levels: [
    { id: 'private', label: 'Only me' },
    { id: 'department', label: 'My department' },
    { id: 'school', label: 'My school' },
    { id: 'district', label: 'District teachers' },
    { id: 'public', label: 'All educators' }
  ],
  permissions: ['view', 'comment', 'edit', 'copy']
};
```

---

## 6. Performance for Low-Resource Schools

### Description
Optimize for schools with limited bandwidth and older devices.

### Performance Targets
- Initial load: < 3 seconds on 3G
- Time to Interactive: < 5 seconds
- Offline capability for core features
- Progressive Web App (PWA) support

### Optimization Strategies
```javascript
// Lazy loading educational content
const LessonContent = lazy(() => 
  import(/* webpackChunkName: "lesson" */ './LessonContent')
);

// Image optimization
const OptimizedImage = ({ src, alt }) => (
  <picture>
    <source srcSet={`${src}?w=400`} media="(max-width: 640px)" />
    <source srcSet={`${src}?w=800`} media="(max-width: 1024px)" />
    <img src={`${src}?w=1200`} alt={alt} loading="lazy" />
  </picture>
);
```

### Caching Strategy
- Service Worker for offline access
- Local storage for work-in-progress
- Sync when connection restored

---

## 7. Contextual Help & Onboarding

### Description
Provide assistance without disrupting workflow, recognizing teachers learn by doing.

### Help Patterns
- **Progressive Onboarding**: Feature tours on first use
- **Contextual Tooltips**: Hover/tap for quick help
- **Video Tutorials**: Embedded where relevant
- **Peer Examples**: Show how others use features

### Implementation
```jsx
// Contextual help system
const ContextualHelp = ({ feature }) => {
  const [showHelp, setShowHelp] = useState(isFirstUse(feature));
  
  return (
    <div className="help-container">
      <button 
        onClick={() => setShowHelp(!showHelp)}
        aria-label="Toggle help"
      >
        <HelpIcon />
      </button>
      {showHelp && (
        <HelpContent feature={feature} onDismiss={() => setShowHelp(false)} />
      )}
    </div>
  );
};
```

  accessibility: AccessibilityConfig;
  permissions: PermissionSet;
  analytics: AnalyticsConfig;
}
```

### State Management
- Use Redux for global educational state
- Local state for UI interactions
- Persist work-in-progress locally
- Sync with backend when possible

### Testing Requirements
1. Accessibility audit for every component
2. Mobile device testing matrix
3. Low-bandwidth simulation tests
4. Teacher usability testing sessions
5. Cross-browser compatibility checks

---

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

1. **Information Overload**: Don't show all features at once
2. **Desktop-Only Thinking**: Avoid hover-dependent interactions
3. **Assumption of Tech Literacy**: Don't assume familiarity with advanced features
4. **Ignoring Context**: Remember teachers work in noisy, interrupted environments
5. **Feature Creep**: Every addition should solve a real teacher problem
