## 🧠 The Knowledge Challenge: Understanding Plone's Enterprise Architecture

### The Starting Reality
When beginning this project, we faced the classic **"Enterprise Legacy Learning Curve"**:

- **Plone CMS**: 25+ years of architectural evolution, 1.1M+ lines of code
- **Complex Component Architecture**: Zope Component Architecture (ZCA), Content Types, Workflows, Permissions
- **Multiple Technology Layers**: Python backend, Zope server, ZODB database, React frontend, REST API
- **Deep Integration Points**: Browser views, behaviors, adapters, utilities, events
- **Legacy Evolution**: Understanding progression from Plone 2.x → 6.1.2

**Traditional Approach**: 2-3 months of manual exploration, documentation reading, trial-and-error coding
**AI-Assisted Approach**: 2-3 weeks of targeted exploration with immediate code implementation

### The AI Strategy: Semantic Exploration Over Linear Learning

Rather than sequentially reading documentation, we employed **AI as an intelligent codebase navigator** to rapidly identify relevant patterns and implementation approaches.

#### Phase 1: Architecture Mapping Through AI Discovery
```
AI Query Strategy: "How does X work in Plone?" → Immediate code examples
Traditional Strategy: Read docs → Search forums → Trial/error → Working code
```

**Sample AI Discovery Session**:
```
Query: "How does Plone integrate JavaScript widgets with Dexterity content types?"
Result: Discovered browser resource registration, pattern system, AJAX integration
Time: 30 minutes
Equivalent Manual Research: 4-6 hours
```

This approach generated the comprehensive architecture documentation in `_project-docs/plone/`, including:
- **plone-overview.md**: Complete system architecture understanding
- **zca-component-map.md**: Component interaction patterns
- **workflow-permissions-map.md**: Security and access control
- **zodb-architecture-map.md**: Data storage and retrieval patterns
