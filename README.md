# K-12 Classroom Management Platform

> **Complete transformation of Plone CMS into a modern classroom command center for K-12 teachers**

A fully implemented platform built on Plone 6.1.2 that modernizes classroom management through real-time digital tools. Production-ready solution helping teachers save 40+ minutes daily on administrative tasks while improving student engagement and classroom organization.

## 🎯 Project Vision

This project demonstrates **enterprise legacy modernization** by evolving Plone CMS (1.1M+ lines of mature Python code) into a specialized K-12 Classroom Management Platform. We preserve Plone's robust content management, security, and workflow capabilities while adding modern, touch-optimized tools for daily classroom operations.

### Target Users: K-12 Teachers (Grades 6-12)
- **Primary Users**: Public school teachers needing efficient classroom management tools
- **Pain Points Solved**: Manual seating charts, unfair participation patterns, substitute preparation chaos, lack of real-time classroom visibility
- **Value Proposition**: Reduce administrative time by 45+ minutes daily while improving classroom equity and organization
